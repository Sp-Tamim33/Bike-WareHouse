                <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">Nodejs is a Javascript engine that you can write any application you want with (by programming in the Javascript language). It runs your Javascript code. Most commonly, it is used to build servers that can respond to web requests, though it can be used for lots of other types of code too.

                    <br />
                    MongoDB is a database engine. Code within some application or server uses MongoDB to save, query or update data in a database. There are many web servers built with nodejs that will then use MongoDB for storing data.

                    MongoDB offers an API library that runs within a Nodejs application to give you programmatic access to MongoDB so you can create databases and then add, query, update or delete data from the MongoDB database.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white"> What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h5>
                <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

                    A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.

                    Once decoded, you will get two JSON strings:

                    The header and the payload.
                    The signature. </p>
